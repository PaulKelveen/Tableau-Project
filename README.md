# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

The goal of this project is to create and create insights using various visualizations and dashboards using data on Real Estate Prices and Incomes across various dsitricts within Canada.
With the insights generated, stakeholders and end users can better understand the changes in real estate prices over the years across various districts in Canada and also see how that compares with changes in earnings over the years as well.

## Process
I started the project by reading the instructions and understanding each of the possible options available to me. <br>
After completing the review, I decided to go with Option 1.
Once that was done, first step was to download the data sets made available to me.
Secondly, I uploaded all the datasets to Tableau, including the CSV and JSON file types.
My next step was to carry out exploratory analysis on the datasets to understand the data and datatypes, check for missing values or manipulations to be carried out to prepare it for visualization.
It was also important to understand the questions and the insights/visualizations to be created. So I reviewed the objectives of the project to align my understanding of the dataset and the insights I needed to create.
Then I proceeded to make the necessary manipulations needed to get the data I need for the visualizations. I also created calculated fields to gain specific insights into the data.
Lastly, I went through each of the objectives, one at a time, selecting the best visualization, and creating insights that will help business leaders and other stakeholders make valuable decisions.
