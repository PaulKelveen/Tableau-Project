# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create insights using various visualizations and dashboards using data on Real Estate Prices and Incomes across various districts within Canada. <br>
With the insights generated, stakeholders and end users can better understand the changes in real estate prices over the years across various districts in Canada and also see how that compares with changes in earnings over the years as well. <br>

## Process
-I started the project by reading the instructions and understanding each of the possible options available to me. <br>
-After completing the review, I decided to go with Option 1. <br>
-Once that was done, first step was to download the data sets made available to me. <br>
-Secondly, I uploaded all the datasets to Tableau, including the CSV and JSON file types. <br>
-My next step was to carry out exploratory analysis on the datasets to understand the data and datatypes, check for missing values or manipulations to be carried out to prepare it for visualization. <br>
-It was also important to understand the questions and the insights/visualizations to be created. So I reviewed the objectives of the project to align my understanding of the dataset and the insights I needed to create. <br>
-Then I proceeded to make the necessary manipulations needed to get the data I need for the visualizations. I also created calculated fields to gain specific insights into the data. <br>
-Lastly, I went through each of the objectives, one at a time, selecting the best visualization, and creating insights that will help business leaders and other stakeholders make valuable decisions. <br>

## Results
-I opted to go with Option 1 and I worked with all 6 datasets made available to me. <br>
-To build meaningful insights for decision makers, I created visualizations using various charts. Key ones used in the project include: <br>
    -Line Chart <br>
    -Tree Map <br>
    -Area Chart <br>
    -Bar Chart <br>
    -Including Trend Analysis for a couple of the graphs. <br>

-In a nutshell, I came up with the following conclusions: <br>
    -The price of homes (and offices) has consistently increased in the last 40 years, with the highest jump happening betwwen 1983 and 1984. <br>
    -The Canadian districts with the most expensive homes are Greater Vancouver, Lower Mainland and Oakville Milton. <br>
    -Across these districts, the difference in the price of homes has also stayed relatively the same. <br> 
    -Earnings accross Canada has also grown at a consistent rate year on year. <br>
    -In 2001, Canadians spent over 150% of their incomes on home expenses. But in 2014, the value dropped significantly to slightly over 50%. <br>
    -I cannot see any direct correlation between the key economic events in the past and incomes or real estate prices in Canada. <br>
    -There is however a slight relationship with the prices of house constructions, with the cost of construction materials experiencing a dip in those key years. <br>
    -Lastly, There isn't any difference between the Consumer Price Index and and House Price Index over the years. They have both grown at the same rate. <br>
    
## Challenges 
-I experienced a couple of challenges while working on the project. <br>
-First, I struggled with importing the JSON file as tableau. The resulting table was not accurate. I resolved this by importing the file into python and using pandas to convert it into a dataframe, then exported it to CSV. <br>
-I also struggled with manipulating data on Tableau but I believe this will improve as I practice more with the application. <br>
-Lastly, I am not sure if it is due to the version of the application I have but I had some limitations with selecting certain visualizations that I needed. <br>

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would have opted for Option 2 and explored one of the other questions. I believe it would have posed a bigger challenge therefore giving me the opportunity to learn and practice more skills. <br>
